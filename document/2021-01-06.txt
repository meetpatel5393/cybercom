Today's work :  

1) Remote repository access practice :
perform task related remote repository , like how can we access someone remote repo. , how we set remote origin in our git bash , how can we push on that repository , how to pull from that repository. this whole task take time because there was some issue related usename and password which is because previous remote access repo. config. isn't changed , letter after doing some research it is resolved.

2) some command like :
$git remote remove remote_name - using this command we can remove that remote from our git bash.

$git remote set-url "url": using this command we can set remote url.

$git log : using this command we can see our history of commit.

$git log -number : these comand show number of history.

execute $git diff command to see which code , i add in file after last commit.

Also i execute add command to see their multiple use's like to tracked the file and to see their modifie status.

$git restore file_name : using this comand we can restore deleted file which i practice

$git branch : this command is use to see all available branch 

create branch and push content on that brach

delete branch using $git branch -d branch_name command

$git revert --abort : command to abort reverting 

git branch -D branch_name: this command is used when
any branch is not fully merged.

git-show : command show log history about HEAD

3) Given Task :
first of all we have one branch called master , master branch have some content in it after that we create another branch called master1 , then we commit in master branch that will generate one checksome number for commit 
after that we push all the content into master1 and merge both branch then , we check log from both branch that have same commit checksum (HEAD ->master and HEAD -> master1) with one merge checksum which i excatly don't know what is it.

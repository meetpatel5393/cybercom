Today i have been watched daily task video and practice on that  , like...
1) practice on object like how can we create object and access it , how can we attach function with object usnig prototype method and the new thing i have notice that if we create object using constructor and that constructor have method so for every object of that constructor have different prototype for that method ,

if we create and attach function using prototype method , so every object same prototype of that function.

2) second i have practice on primitive data type and object

3) complete practice task of 2 html and 2 js

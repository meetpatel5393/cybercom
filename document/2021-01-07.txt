Command practice :

1) git diff : practice on this command to check difference of content using two commit number

2) giff diff -HEAD : this command work same as git diff old commit - new commit , this command check different between content of last commit and the latest content (without commit that) , and we don't need to add that file  , after change we can directly check the difference

3) $ git diff HEAD:test.txt abc.txt
- this command show different between two file , if we change content of the file and then we want to see different then commit of that file is necesary

4) $ git diff --color-words commit_id1 commit_id2 : this command show that if new content is add then it's show that content in green color otherwise if content is delet then it content show in red color

5) git commit -m "msg" filename : this command only push single file which we are specifiy at the end of this command

6) git add --all : to add all file at a time

7) Resolve conflict practice while merging

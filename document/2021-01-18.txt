Today i have been watched daily task video and practice on that  , like...

1) practice on arrow function and generic function like how can we define both of them and how this keyword work with it in both function that different i have seen.
in simple generic function like we have one object and one function in it so in that function if we define another function so insdie that inner function 'this'  reffer as a window object , but in arrow function if we have another inner arrow function so then 'this' keyword inside that arrow function reffer 'this' of outer function , so basically in arrow function we don't need to pass this externally in inner function arrow function automatically assume that.

2) this value inside a regular function is dynamic and depends on the invocation , But this inside the arrow function is bound lexically and equals to this of the outer function.

3) the second topic which i have learn is implicit  return in regular function vs arrow function like , If the arrow function contains one expression, and you omit the functionâ€™s curly braces, then the expression is implicitely returned. These are the inline arrows function. so it automatically return the value but if we have more than one line of code in arrow function so returning the value work same as regular function.

4) Now object creation.. , like in regular function we can create object using 'new' keyword but in arrow function we can't. and syntax of arrow function and all that stuff i have seen and practice on that 

5) Complete daily task which is one html form.

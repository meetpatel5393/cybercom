Today i have learn something intersting concept of php that is object oriented programming which is very usefull , so here i'm mentioned the topic list on which i have done practice.

1) try-throw-catch : which is use to handle exception.

2) custom exception : using this we can create our own exception and error message.

3) class-properties-method-constructor : this all are the core concept of oop.

4) access specifier : public , private , protected.

5) constance : which hold constance value in it.

6) Inheritance : which is usefull to reuse existing thing without write that again , in this i have practice on single , multilevel inheritance.

7) final keyword : the use of final keyword is to prevent inherit of class and override a method.

8) static properties , method :

9) namespace : They allow for better organization by grouping classes that work together to perform a task..

10) abstract class , method : which is use to provide abstraction.  An abstract method is a method that is declared, but not implemented in the code. Abstract function cannot contain body. An abstract class is a class that contains at least one abstract method.

11) interface : interface provide next level abstraction. Interfaces may not include member variables.
 The classes that implement the interfaces must define all the methods that they inherit from the interfaces.
 All the methods in the interface must be in the public visibility scope.

12) type hinting : which is allow us to specifie datatype in argument of function , so that function only allow that type of data in parameter.
